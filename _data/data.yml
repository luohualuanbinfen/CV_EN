        This project mainly studies the dynamic performance of <b>a new composite structure--TGCW</b> (Trough girder with corrugated steel webs), and the expected results can be listed as follows:
        </br> 1. <b>Derive the theoretical formula</b> of vertical bending natural vibration frequency of TGCW after considering the coupling effect of shear lag and shear deformation. 
        </br> 2. Carry out <b>laboratory dynamic characteristic test</b> to verify the accuracy of the derived formula. 
        </br> 3. Use multi-body dynamics software and finite element software to co-simulate the <b>train-track-bridge system</b>, and analyze the influencing factors of the system's coupling vibration.
        </br> 4. Analyze the influence of vehicle speed, uneven road surface, and bridge structure parameters on the <b>impact coefficient</b> of the bridge, optimize the design of the structure, and put forward reasonable structural design suggestions.

        The project aimed at putting forward a suitable <b>pile foundation underpinning</b> plan, considering the surrounding environment, construction conditions, and working space on site, for the problem--a tunnel (between Fujian Road Station and Chenghe Village Station on Nanjing Metro Line 7) crossing through pile foundations of bridges(Fujian Road Bridge and Fujian Road West Bridge).
        </br> - I was responsible for establishing the finite element model of underpinning pile foundation and cap through <b>MIDAS/FEA</b>;
        </br> - By analyzing the axial force and vertical displacement of pile foundation, the internal force of cover beam and pile cap, to ensure the safety of bridge structure during pile foundation underpinning and shield construction;

        The study mainly focused on the causes of early cracking of a prestressed concrete box-girder bridge’s top slab in the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway Highway of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. 
        </br> -Through FEM, the study confirmed that the <b>age difference</b> of the layered pouring concrete and the uneven temperature field inside the box girder caused by the <b>concrete hydration heat effect</b> could raise difference in shrinkage between top slab and web of the box girder were the two main factors ( <b>first-level factors</b> ) causing cracks in the box girder roof in this project;
        </br> -By analyzing the influence of controllable factors (<b>secondary factors</b>) such as <b>changes in concrete elastic modulus, layered pouring time interval, reinforcement arrangement, and linear expansion coefficient</b>, on cracking degree, reasonable suggestions were made for material selection, design method, and construction measures to improve the early cracking state of the concrete box girder.

        This project took the <b>maintenance and reconstruction</b> of the <b>concrete bridge decks of the upper highway of the main bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge</b> as the research background.
        The impact of reconstruction methods on bridge performance was analyzed based on the given upper road highway concrete deck system reform plan (replacing the original bridge deck system with <b>an orthotropic steel structure deck system</b> ).
        </br> -I was the project leader, responsible for establishing the finite element model of the bridge during <b>each stage of repair and reconstruction</b>, and analyzing the stress state of the truss members and the bridge deck system under the dead load and train  through <b>ANSYS<\b>. The rationality of the construction process was carried out based on the analysis.
