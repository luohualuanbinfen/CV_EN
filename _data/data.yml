        </br> 1. Through theoretical calculation, derive the calculation formula of the vertical bending natural vibration frequency after considering the shear lag and shear deformation of the corrugated steel web composite groove beam. 
        </br> 2. Carry out laboratory dynamic characteristic test on the new structure, measure the vibration frequency of the model, and combine the finite element model to verify the correctness and accuracy of the derived formula. 
        </br> 3. Use multi-body dynamics software and finite element software to jointly simulate the multi-body system model of the train track bridge, and analyze the influencing factors of the vehicle-bridge coupling vibration to
        And the solution of the impact coefficient.
        </br> 4. Analyze the influence of vehicle speed, uneven road surface, and bridge structure parameters on the impact coefficient of the bridge, optimize the design of the structure, and put forward reasonable structural design suggestions.

        The solid finite element method is used to analyze the causes of early cracking of the box beam roof. 
        </br> -The study confirmed that the <b>age difference of</b> the <b>layered concrete and the</b> uneven temperature field inside the box girder caused by the <b>hydration heat effect</b> of the <b>concrete</b> will cause the difference in shrinkage between the top and bottom webs of the box girder.
        These are the two main factors ( <b>first-level factors</b> ) that cause cracks in the box girder roof of this project;
        </br> -By analyzing the influence of controllable factors ( <b>secondary factors</b> ) such as <b>changes in concrete elastic modulus, layered pouring time interval, reinforcement arrangement and linear expansion coefficient</b> , on the degree of cracking,
        Based on the second-level factors, reasonable suggestions are made for the material selection, design method and construction measures of cast-in-place concrete box girder to improve the early cracking of the top of the cast-in-situ concrete box girder.
