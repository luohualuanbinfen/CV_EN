        <div align="center"><img src="assets/images/XLZQKL_JSLX.png" width="60%"></img></div>
        </br> -The study confirmed that the <b>age difference of</b> the <b>layered concrete and the</b> uneven temperature field inside the box girder caused by the <b>hydration heat effect</b> of the <b>concrete</b> will cause the difference in shrinkage between the top and bottom webs of the box girder.
        These are the two main factors ( <b>first-level factors</b> ) that cause cracks in the box girder roof of this project;
        </br> -By analyzing the influence of controllable factors ( <b>secondary factors</b> ) such as <b>changes in concrete elastic modulus, layered pouring time interval, reinforcement arrangement and linear expansion coefficient</b> , on the degree of cracking,
        Based on the second-level factors, reasonable suggestions are made for the material selection, design method and construction measures of cast-in-place concrete box girder to improve the early cracking of the top of the cast-in-situ concrete box girder.
